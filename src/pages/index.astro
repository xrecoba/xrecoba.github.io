     I've been developing Software since 2003 and during those years I've done my fair share of mistakes, I even learnt something from some of them. Somehow during this trip it came to me the opportunity to teach and I did like it, a lot.
    <p></p><p></p><p></p>
    
     Other persons and companies also seem to appreciate my collaboration as consultant (still wonder why, but who am I to discuss with them - the only thing I can say is 'It depends').

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">Why a personal website?</h3>
    Because I want to (that should be reason enough ðŸ˜‹). Also, because the people from Stackbit, Netlify and Gatsby made it really easy for me to create one (thanks!) and because I sell services (trainings, consultancy) and well... it kinda helps.
    <p></p>
    Although I don't consider me a super expert in the things I teach, I try to be good at teaching them. I only dare to teach stuff I had some practical real live experience with (there are some rare exceptions, usually with disclaimers and because I'd like to share if I think there's something that could be better or insightful)
    <p></p>
    On top of all those reasons, there are some things I'd like to experiment with, like writing some of my personal stories, ideas, learnings or just sketches so I can look them up after a while (and even help somebody else who finds those useful).
